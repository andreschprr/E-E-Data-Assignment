Project deliveries
----------------------

The Data Assignment solution has five elements:
1. A PDF generated from an RMarkdown file "Data Assignment 12215739.Rmd"
2. The RMardown file that generated the PDF "Data Assignment 12215739.pdf"
3. An R file with the same code as the RMarkdown "R file - Data Assignment.R"
4. The inputs files I used "Question1.Rdata", "Part1.Rdata", "Part2.Rdata"
5. This ReadMe file "README.md

-------------------------
Comments on code
-------------------------

The R file doesn't save any graphs, it just prints them.
The R file has some comments briefly explaining what I did in each question
Both R and Rmd files use the inputs I uploaded to GitHub so there should be no need to update them
