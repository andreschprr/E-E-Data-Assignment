The Data Assignment solution has five elements:
1. A PDF generated from an RMarkdown file
2. The RMardown file that generated the PDF
3. An R file with the same code as the RMarkdown
4. The inputs files I used
5. This ReadMe file

Comments on code
-------------------------

The R file doesn't save any graphs, it just prints them. I preferred to do an R
RMarkdown because I think it is easier to read and if you want to check at any
of the code then you can take a look at either of the code files

At the beginning of both code files I created a variable with the address so
it is easier to just change at the beginning if one wants to read the code
